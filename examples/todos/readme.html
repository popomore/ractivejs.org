<p>This is an adaptation of the <a href='http://todomvc.com/'>TodoMVC</a> application. <span class='logo'>Ractive.js</span> doesn't take a side in the MVC wars &ndash; it aims to be architecturally agnostic &ndash; so whereas other TodoMVC implementations have a strict separation between models, views and controllers, <span class='logo'>Ractive.js</span> lets you structure your app how you see fit.</p>

<p>Often, your 'model' will be a plain old JavaScript object or array. Array mutator methods (<code>push</code>, <code>pop</code>, <code>shift</code>, <code>unshift</code>, <code>splice</code>, <code>reverse</code> and <code>sort</code>) are wrapped (by default &ndash; this behaviour can be prevented) so that the view gets updated with the least amount of work. See the <a href='https://github.com/RactiveJS/Ractive/wiki/Array-modification'>wiki page on array modification</a> for more info.</p>

<p>This example also demonstrates <a href='https://github.com/RactiveJS/Ractive/wiki/Events#proxy-events'>proxy events</a> &ndash; which translate DOM events (such as mouse and keyboard interactions) into <em>domain events</em> (such as 'add item' or 'mark all as complete') &ndash; and <a href='https://github.com/RactiveJS/Ractive/wiki/Transitions'>transitions</a>, which automate things like the slide down/up animations when you add/remove a todo.</p>
