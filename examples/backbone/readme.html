<p><span class='logo'>Ractive.js</span> isn't an MVC framework, because MVC isn't the only way to build apps. Rather than dressing up your data with dedicated Model classes, you can use plain old JavaScript objects &ndash; POJOs.</p>

<p>That's handy, but sometimes it's not enough &ndash; maybe you want to use Backbone (for example) Models and Collections in your app, but you still want to use Ractive to render your interface.</p>

<p>In these situations, we use <em>adaptors</em>. Adaptors are small plugins that allow Ractive to communicate seamlessly with third-party model libraries. In the example above, we're using the <a href='https://github.com/RactiveJS/Ractive/blob/master/plugins/adaptors/Backbone.js'>Backbone adaptor</a>. We have a variety of model types (<code>Film</code>, <code>Actor</code> and <code>Director</code>) and a collection type (<code>Films</code>).</p>

<p>As Ractive builds up the view, any time it encounters an instance of a Backbone Model, it does two things. Firstly, it wraps the object so that you can do <code>film.title</code> in your template (rather than <code>film.get( 'title' )</code> or <code>film.attributes.title</code>). Secondly, it adds a handler to the model's <code>change</code> event, so that changes in the model are reflected in the view. This binding works in both directions &ndash; changes in the view will also be reflected in the model, where appropriate.</p>

<p>Later, if the model is no longer in use, the event handler will be removed automatically.</p>

<p>This means we have the best of both worlds &ndash; we have Ractive's simplicity, but with the power of Backbone's helper methods. For example when you roll over the actor or director name in the top left, you see a list of credits constructed using the collection's <code>pluck</code> method:</p>

<pre>
<code>&lt;div class='credits-list'&gt;Credits: {{ credits.pluck( 'title' ).join( ', ' ) }}&lt;/div&gt;</code>
</pre>

<p>This is possible because each <code>Actor</code> and <code>Director</code> instance has a <code>credits</code> property, which is an instance of the <code>Films</code> collection type.</p>

<p>Notice also that within the <code>highlight</code> event handler, we're using the <code>set</code> event on the Backbone object rather than on Ractive, which is a more object-oriented approach if that's your bag.</p>
