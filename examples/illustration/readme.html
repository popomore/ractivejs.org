<p>You can take illustrations produced with <a href='http://inkscape.org'>Inkscape</a> or <a href='http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html'>Adobe Illustrator</a> and add interactivity to them by hand-editing the SVG source code.</p>

<p>It's not exactly straightforward &ndash; you have to know your way around SVG, and you have to deal with all the cruft that illustration software adds to the markup &ndash; but it's possible, and <span class='logo'>Ractive.js</span> makes it easier than it otherwise would be. Hopefully, in future, we'll have better tools for allowing artists and developers to work together on the web.</p>
