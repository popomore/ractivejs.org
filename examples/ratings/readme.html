<p>Creating a simple star rating widget is the kind of thing that quickly turns to spaghetti if you try and build it by hand, or even with jQuery &ndash; lots of manually adding and removing classes, probably using tricks like <code>$.index()</code> or <code>this.getAttribute( 'data-index' )</code> and other such horrors.</p>

<p>Because <span class='logo'>Ractive.js</span> is stateful, and uses dependency tracking to propagate changes efficiently (in other words, it enables what is often referred to as 'reactive programming'), there are no such headaches.</p>

<p>This demonstration was inspired by this <a href='http://www.quora.com/Pete-Hunt/Posts/Facebooks-React-vs-AngularJS-A-Closer-Look'>Quora post from Pete Hunt</a>, lead developer of <a href='http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html'>React</a>, which sought to compare React to AngularJS.</p>

<p>There's way too much of this kind of Angular v Ember v React v [insert framework here] chest-beating in our community, and I don't want to add to it (though Pete's post was a legitimate defence of React). But look how much simpler the <span class='logo'>Ractive.js</span> code is!</p>
