<p>Inspired by <a href='https://medium.com/make-your-own-apps/e71bcedc36b'>this snarky Medium blog post</a> comparing <a href='http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html'>React</a> to <a href='http://angularjs.org/'>AngularJS</a>, this example shows how easy it is to create a simple commenting widget.</p>

<p>It uses the <a href='https://github.com/coreyti/showdown'>Showdown</a> library to convert Markdown to HTML before inserting it using a 'triple-stache'. (Note that <span class='logo'>Ractive.js</span> doesn't sanitize HTML before inserting it &ndash; that's the app's responsibility.)</p>

<p>The code for submitting a comment is mostly self-explanatory. The <code>post</code> proxy event's <em>original</em> is the underlying <code>submit</code> DOM event &ndash; we prevent its default (which would reload the page). Later, we fire a <code>new comment</code> event, onto which we can hook additional events, such as saving to a server:</p>

<pre>
<code>ractive.on( 'new comment', function ( comment ) {
   
	// send comment to server...
	$.post( backendURL, comment, function ( comments ) {

		// ...and make sure we've got the latest (sanitized!) comments
		ractive.set( 'comments', comments );
	});
});</code>
</pre>
